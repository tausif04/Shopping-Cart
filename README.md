Simple Shopping Cart
This is a front-end web application that implements a simple, responsive shopping cart using HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript. The application fetches product data from a local JSON file and allows users to add items to a cart, update quantities, apply a discount, and checkout.

Features
Dynamic Product Loading: Products are loaded asynchronously from a products.json file.

Add to Cart: Users can add products to their shopping cart from the product list.

Cart Management:

View all items in the cart with their price, quantity, and subtotal.

Update the quantity of each item directly in the cart.

Remove individual items from the cart.

Clear the entire cart with a single click.

Discount Code: Apply a predefined discount code (Ostad) to get a 10% discount on the total amount.

Real-time Calculation: The total price is automatically updated when items are added, quantities are changed, or a discount is applied.

Responsive Design: The layout adjusts for smaller screen sizes, providing a good user experience on mobile devices.

Technologies Used
HTML5: For the basic structure and layout of the web page.

CSS3: For styling the components, including the use of Grid for layout.

Vanilla JavaScript (ES6+): For all the application logic, including DOM manipulation, event handling, and asynchronous operations (async/await for fetching data).
